A simulation of a scintilation detector system
The cosmic-ray antimuon decay at rest is simulated using Geant4 version geant4-11.3.2.

=========================== DETECTOR STRUCTURE ==========================
1. Scintillator bars:
	Number of bars: 8
	Dimension: 25 cm X 2.5 cm X 1 cm
	Material: Polystyrene C8H8
	There is a hole inside each bar to place a wavelength shifting fiber.
	Scintillator Coating: 15% TiO2 and 85% polystyrene by weight
	
2. Wavelength shifting fibers (WLSs): the structure is the same as Kuraray Y-11 type
	Number of fibers: 8
	Dimension: Diameter: 1 mm, length: 26 cm
	Material: C9H10
	One end of the fiber is covered by Aluminium foil.
	There are 2 claddings cover each fiber.
	Inner cladding: C5H8O2
	Outer cladding: C2H4
	
3. MPPC and place holder:
	At the moment, MPPC is just a piece of Aluminium and the holder is a piece of air.
	
The dimension of all components can be set by user UI commands starting with /scinsm/....
	
The material properties used of the scinitlators and WLSs are quite similar as the ones used in the T2K ND280.
	
=========================== PRIMARY GENERATOR ===========================
The simulation uses G4 General Particle Source.
For simplicity, A point source of Antimuons of 22 MeV kinetic energy is placed at (0, 3, 0) cm, aligned spin (0, 1, 0) along Y axis and momentum direction vertically downward. With this source, antimuons can decay at rest inside scinitlator.

=========================== PHYSICS LIST ================================
The Geant4 recommended FTFP_BERT physics list is used. The recommended electromagnetic constructor is G4EmStandardPhysics_option4 (EMZ).
The decay physics constructor is G4SpinDecayPhysics. This constructor considers the particle polarization while the G4DecayPhysics does not.
All is included in a PhysicsList class by default.
You can use other physics lists and constructors by command option.

=========================== SENSITIVE DETECTOR ==========================
1. MPPC: Save optical photon hit information: Arrival time, energy,...

2. Scintillators: Save antimuon and the decay product hit information: energy deposit, energy of the products, decay position,...

=========================== ANALYSIS ====================================
A 1D histogram is built on the angle between the charged daughter momentum direction and the parent antimuon polarization vector.
At the moment, all the optical photon tracks are killed to save run time.

=========================== HOW TO RUN ==================================
Build the programme with cmake and make.
The simulation runs in multi worker threads. Number of Threads = 6 (default). You should choose the number of threads less than the number of CPU cores by 2.

1. Interactive mode:
	Simply run command: ./scinsm
	It will automatically run the vis.mac to visualise the detector, hits, tracks,...
	
2. Batch mode:
	Command: ./scinsm [-m macro] [-p physicsList] [-t nThreads] [-v | --verbose] [-h | --help]
	
	The macro for this mode is test.mac
	The physics list can choose as you prefer. For instance, run the programme with option "-p FTFP_BERT_EMZ+G4SpinDecayPhysics", it means you use FTFP_BERT physics list and replace by "G4EmStandardPhysics_option4" (the underscore means replacing a physics constructor) and add G4SpinDecayPhysics (the plus means adding a physics constructor)
	Number of threads can set using -t flag.
